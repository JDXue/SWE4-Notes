### Maintenence
The end of the lifecyle for a project

#### People involved
###### 1st Line Support
- first line of contact
- unlikely to have strong technical skills
- provide assistance for basic problems

###### 2nd Line Support
- Have more of an idea of how the system works
- Can provide solutions that are less common, but cannot not make changes to the code itself


###### 3rd Line Support
- More technical and domain knowledge of the system
- Likely to be developers, infra, testers who have worked on the system
- Can mke changes to the system or the code in order to fix the problem

###

#### Problem Solving Techniques
1. Identify the problem
2. Isolate the problem
3. Is it something that has been encountered before?
4. Ask why it might happen
5. Investigate the possible causes
6. Work backwards through the causes/changes until you can find the root of the problem
7. Theorise the possible solutions
8. Implement the best solution

- don't rush through the solution if you can help it
- don't spend too long looking at the problem without taking breaks

###

##### Keplar Tregoe's Root Cause Analysis
- Above the surface you can see the _symptoms_ of the problem
- Dig deeper to find the _root cause_ of the problem


###### Situational Analysis
- Identify the situation - what has gone wrong

###### Problem Analysis
- Define the problem, and go backwards to find the root cause
- Test the basics to try and highlight the likely root cause
- Ask others to see if this a a problem that happens regularly

###### Decision Analysis
- Work through potential solutions for the cause
- Understand the pros and cons of the potential solutions to find the best next decision

###### Potential Problem Analysis
- What are the potential risks of the chosen solution?
- Are there any ways of mitigating these risks?

###

*fault tree analysis* breaking down the problem and identifying solution by depicting them in a top to bottom tree diagram

*ishikawa (fishbone) diagram* team exercise, starting with the top-level problems and working down to the possible causes (typical categories are People, Processes, Methods, Environments, Tools)
