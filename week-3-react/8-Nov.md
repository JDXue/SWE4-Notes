### Using Custom Hooks

Using the atomic hooks of React (e.g. useState, useEffect, useReducer etc.) a develper can make custom hooks.

Libraries on GitHub can be downloaded using npm for custom hooks.

* Don't use a hook in a conditional statement
* Don't call methods within the main body

**Linter** Something that checks library / language rules that warns developer when they break rules
