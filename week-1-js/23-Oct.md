## Object Oriented Programming
### Object Oriented Porgramming is often used to represent entities that  cna be repretented in real life

#### Initialising an object

The class defining an object in js always starts with a constructor (called constructor) and it uses the dot notation with 'this' to define a new property


``` js

//defining a new class to decribe a cat
class Cat{
    constructor(){
        this.ears = 2
        this.eyes = "green and cute"
        this.tail = 1
    }
}
```


## OOP is well suited for cresting code that is easier to read and can

# Keyboard Shorcuts

**cmd + D** Highlight the last character
**cmd + L** Highlight line-by-line
**alt + up** / down Move highlighted code up and down the file
**cmd + shift + F** searches for key term in all files

### MVP

MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is the mindset that involves creating a product that meets the requirements of the client needs with the least amount of effort, where the product is still fully functional

#### TDD for MVP

Use event keywords to help create nested tests for the product:
 --> **GIVEN**
    --> **WHEN**
        --> **THEN**


#### Example ####
``` js

```
