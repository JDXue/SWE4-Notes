# Object Oriented Programming

### Object Oriented Porgramming is often used to represent entities that  cna be repretented in real life

#### Initialising an object

The class defining an object in js always starts with a constructor (called constructor) and it uses the dot notation with 'this' to define a new property


``` js

//defining a new class to decribe a cat
class Cat{
    constructor(){
        this.ears = 2
        this.eyes = "green and cute"
        this.tail = 1
    }
}
```
