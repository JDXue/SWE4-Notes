**If a part of code is very likely to change another part of code, it is best to make sure that they are kept together**

### Component Libraries

It is rare that a  person will have to make components in React all of the time, because many of the components used in programs are able to be sourced from a component someone has already used to reduce time creating CSS functionality, and make sure that different parts of the program have the same appearance
* React Bootstrap
* Material UI
* Semantic UI
* Antdesign
* Ionic React

## Simon Says

### Setup

* [x] Board with 2 x 2 cells (buttons)
* [x] Assigned colours to each cell
* [x] Instructions displayed above board
* [x] Start button

### User Play
* [x] User can click on colour to add colour to an array
* [x] When start button is pressed, the computer will randomly select a sequence of colours
* [x] Each colour in computer's sequence should come up as text

*




* [ ] Each colour chosen by the computer in the sequence should change the corresponding colour of each button in sequence
