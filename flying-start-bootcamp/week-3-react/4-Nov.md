* Make sure long argument lists have each argument on a new line
* Have ending tags in-line with the starting tag
* When nested, indent one level
* Have a space at the beginning and at the end of parentheses
* Allow ternary functions to be laid out like a typical if statement if not on one line
* Take functions or parsed in variables out of the main code if it is too long and rename
